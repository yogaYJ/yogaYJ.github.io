1.  `状语的双黄蛋`

双黄蛋例子 

I love you and I hate you. 

I love you because I hate you.

**Example:** **The physicist** rightly **dreads** **precise argument**, since an argument that is convncing only if it is precise loses all its force if the assumptions on which it is based are alightly changed, [whereas] an argument that is convincing though imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions.

--&gt;&gt;物理学家合理的害怕精确论断，因为如果他所记的前提被轻微改变，那么仅仅在精确时才有说服力的论断将会丧失它所有的力量，但是一个并不精确却具有说服力的论断在其基本假设发生轻微干扰的时候将会依然稳定可靠。

**Example:** The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind [and] it is simply the mode by which (,通过这个模式) all phenomena are reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation.

--&gt;&gt; 科学调查的方法不过是人类思维工作必要模式的表达，并且它只不过是一种模式，通过这种模式，所有的现象被推理并且被给出精确的解释。

**Example:** **You have all heard it** repeated [同位语从句]①that men of science work by means of induction and deduction [and] ②that by the help of these operations,**they**,in a sort of sense,**manage to extract** form behind the cover of mysterious Nature **certain natural laws** that rule the world with certainty.

①并列 ②主干定位 ③各自处理

--&gt;&gt; 你经常反复听到科学家们通过归纳和演绎的方式工作，并且还说在这些工作的帮助下，他们，在某种程度上从神奇的自然界表象背后成功的发掘出了以稳定性去统治这个世界的自然法则。

**Example:**And it is imagined by many that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes,and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special training.

--&gt;&gt; 很多人认为普通思维的运行绝对不能够和这些进程相比较，并且还认为他们可以通过一些特殊训练来获得。

**Example:**In short,a leader of the new school contends that the scientific revolution,as we call it,was largely the improvement and invention and use of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in innumberable directions.

**Example:** Over the years,**tools and technology** themselves as a source of fundamental innovation **have largely been ignored** by historians and philosophers of science. 

--&gt;&gt;很多年以来，作为基础革新来源的科学和技术本上很大程度上被科学界的历史学家以及哲学家们所忽略了。

**Example:** How well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends upon the amount,reliability,and appropriateness of the information used [and] on the skill and wisdom with which it is interepted.

--&gt;&gt; 预言将会如何被后来的实际表现所证实，依赖于所使用的信息的数量、可靠性和恰当性，以及依赖于用来解释它的技术和智慧。

**Example:**This trend began during the Second World War,when several governments came to the conclusion that the specific demands that a government wants to make of its scientific establishment cannot generally be foreseen in detail.

--&gt;&gt; 这个趋势是从二战时期开始的，在那时很多政府都达成一个结论，即在科学成就上政府所想要做出的具体要求不能被详细的预见到。
