### Diversity 现实的多样性

1.主要调整：名词性从句的计算

*注：名词性从句：从句是一个完整的句子

宾语从句，如I think that...

主语从句，如That...is good

同位语从句 I have an idea that ...

**Example:** I think that the man in the car is Tom.（宾语从句）

**处理方法**

*从句部分 单独处理

**Example:** **主**The Greeks **谓**assumed **宾语从句**that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, 1)which took root 2)in Europe 3)long before 4)people realized 5)how diverse language could be.

** Example:** **He** **believes** （宾语从句）that **this very difficulty** **may have had** **the compensating advantage** （定语）of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, [and] thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations.

** Example: ** **A long-held view** of the history of English colonies that became the United States **has been** **that** [主语]England's policy toward these colonies before 1763 [谓语]was dictated [小状语]by commercial interests **[and] that** [主语]a change to a more imperical policy, dominated by expansionist militarist objectives,[谓语]generated the tensions that ultimately led to the American Revolution.

--&gt;&gt; 对成为美国的英国殖民地历史的长期观点认为，在1763年之前针对这些殖民地的英国的政策是根据商业利益而被制定的，并且还认为朝向更加帝国主义化政策的改变，在扩张主义军事目标的主导下，产生了最终导致美国革命的紧张局面。

##### `同位语从句：用一句话解释一个词`

##### `翻译方式: ","+即+句子单独处理`

 ** Example: **

I agree with the idea that you told me.

I agree with the idea that she is beautiful.（同位语从句，对内容的解释）我同意这个观点，即她很漂亮。

** Example: ** **The great interest** in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades **indicates** **the strong feeling** in our society *that （all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.）

--&gt;&gt; 在过去三十多年中，在公众教育领域被显示出来的针对智障儿童的巨大兴趣，表明了我们社会中的强烈感受，即所有市民，不论他们的特殊状况是什么，都应该得到充分发展他们能力的机会。
